What is does:
copies data from one table into a new table.


Syntax for copy all columns into a new table
SELECT *
INTO newtable [IN externaldb]
FROM oldtable
WHERE condition;

Syntax for copy some columns into a new table
SELECT column1,column2,column3...
INTO newtable [IN externaldb]
FROM oldtable
WHERE condition;

- The new table will be created with the column-names and types as defined in the old table. You can create new column names using the AS
clause.


(SELECT INTO can also be used to create a new, empty table using the schema of another. Just add a WHERE clause that causes the query to return no data:)

SELECT * INTO newtable 
FROM oldtable
WHERE 1 = 0;
