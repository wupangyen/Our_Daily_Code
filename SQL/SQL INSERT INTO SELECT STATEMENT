- copies data from one table and inserts it into another table.
- requires that the data types in source and target tables match.
Note: The existing records in the target table are unaffected.

Insert into select syntax
copy all columns from one table to another table:

INSERT INTO table2
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE condition;

Copy only some columns from one table into another table:

INSERT INTO table2 (column1, column2, column3, ...)
SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
FROM table1
WHERE condition;


Example:
The following SQL statement copies only the German suppliers into "Customers":

INSERT INTO Customers ((CustomerName, CIty,Country)
SELECT SupplierName, City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country ='Germany';
