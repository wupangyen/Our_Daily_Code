groups rows that have the same val into summary rows, like find the num of customers in each country 

often used with aggregate functions(COUNT() MAX() MIN() SUM() AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns 

- The SQL GROUP BY clause is used in collaboration with the SELECT statement to arrange identical data into groups. This Group by clause follows the where clause in a SELECT 
statement and precedes the Order by clause.


Group BY Syntax:


SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition 
GROUP BY column_name(s)
ORDER BY column_name(s)
