ANY and ALL operators allow you to perform a comparison between a single column value and a range of other values 

For ANY Operator

Two points to focus on 
1. returns a boolean value as a result
2. returns TRUE if ANY of the subquery values meet the condition 

ANY means that the condition will be true if  the operation is true for any of the values in the range

ANY Syntax

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator ANY
  (SELECT column_name
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition);
    

(The operator must be a standard comparison operator( =, <>, !=, >, >=, <, or <=))

For ALL operator:
 there are 3 points
 1.returns a boolean value as a result
 2.returns TRUE if ALL of the subquery values meet the condition
 3.is used with SELECT, WHERE and HAVING statements

ALL means that the condition will be true only if the operation is true for all values in the range 

ALL Syntax With SELECT

SELECT ALL column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

ALL Syntax With WHERE or Having

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator ALL
 (SELECT column_name
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition
 
 );
