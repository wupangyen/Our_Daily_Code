case statement goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met(like an if-then--else statement). So, once a
condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result. If no conditions are true, it returns the values in the ELSE clause.

If there is no ELSE part and no conditions are true, it returns NULL.

CASE Syntax
CASE
    When condition1 then result1
    when condition2 then result2
    when conditionN then resultN
    ELSE result
END;


Example:

SELECT OrderID, Quantity,
CASE
    WHEN QUantity > 30 THEN 'The quantity is greater than 30'
    WHEN QUantity = 30 THEN 'The quantity is 30'
    ELSE 'The quantity is under 30'
END AS QuantityText
FROM OrderDetails;
