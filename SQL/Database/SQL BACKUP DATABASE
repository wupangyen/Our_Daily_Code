The BACKUP DATABASE statement is used in SQL Server to create a full back up an existing SQL database.

Syntax

BACKUP DATABASE database name
TO DISK = 'filepath'

- The SQL BACKUP With Differential Statement
- A differential back up only backs up the parts of the database that have changed since the last full database backup

Syntax:

BACKUP DATABASE databasename
To DISK = 'filepath'
WITH DIFFERENTIAL;

Example: The following SQL statement created a full back up of the existing database "testDB" to the D disk :

Example:
BACKUP DATABASE testDB
TO DISK = 'D:\backups\testDB.bak';


BACKUP WITH DIFFERENTIAL EXAMPLE
The following SQL statement created a differential back up of the database "testDB":

Example:
BACKUP DATABASE testDB
TO DISK = 'D:\backups\testDB.bak'
WITH DIFFERENTIAL;

- A differential back up reduces the back up time(since only the changes are backed up )
