SELECT a.Field1, a.Field2, b.Field1
FROM TABLE A a JOIN TABLEB b on a.Field1 = b.Field1

SQL run through with no problem, we prefixed each column with an alias(table) name.
But SSRS uses only the column name as the key, not table + column 

The Fix is rename the second column, i.e. b.Field1 AS Field01
