UNION Syntax
SELECT column__name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;


For UNION ALL Syntax
The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate values, use UNION ALL:
SELECT column__name(s) FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;


Example
SELECT 'Customer' AS Type, ContactName, City, Country
FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT 'Supplier', ContactName, City, Country
FROM Suppliers;

Summary:
"AS Type" it is an alias - used to give a table or a column a temp name 

temp column named "Type" list whether contact person is a customer or a supplier
