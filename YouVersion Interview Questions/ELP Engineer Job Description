Who you are:
Naturally inquisitive and excited to create new methodologies and systems
I am always curious about how things actually works. If I don't understand or familer about topic, I will spend time put in the 
hours until it clicks in my brain and be able to explain to others in simple words. So for the last question in the hacker rank I am not really familer with how restful api works, after the accessment I give a call to my friend who are more familer with
this topic, we talked and discuss about what online I can read, what small project is a good start to pratice about it. Because i believe the best way to understand a unknown topic is through a small project.


A team player, looking to maximize efforts through collaboration
- in past job as a repair technician, there is an example I have as a team player and looking to maximize efforts through
collaboration, there is one time just me and the other person in the store, but we have a lot of customers come in for repair. about 10 to 15 devices in the queue waiting for
repair. So we dicuss a plan, since I am good at communicating with the customer at the front desk and quicker at the check in check out workflow, I told him I will stay here all day today. And including the phone calls I will take care of it 
And since he is faster at repairing I tell him, just focus on repair don't worry about customer at the front and the calls
at the end of the day before we close the store, we finished all the repairs in the queue with just two of us
